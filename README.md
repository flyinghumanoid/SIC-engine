# SIC-engine
Project for Systems Programming class, create a SIC engine. Reads assembly file then initiates a two pass compiler (converting to .obj file) then executing assembly instructions.


A simulated shell environment in which we can load assembly files compatible with our SIC Engine. The engine generates an intermediate object file complete with opcodes and their relevant instructions.
